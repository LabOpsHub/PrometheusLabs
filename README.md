# PrometheusLabs

**PrometheusLabs** PrometheusLabs is an open-source community project dedicated to hands-on learning with the Prometheus stack. Each lab is designed to be run locally, allowing you to experiment, break things, and learn in a safe environment. We provide automated checks for your work, ensuring immediate feedback and a deeper understanding of the tools and practices involved.

## Overview

1. **Local Labs**  
   All labs can be spun up locally using Docker, Docker Compose, or other container orchestration tools. This approach ensures minimal setup and consistent, reproducible environments.

2. **Hands-on Exercises**  
   Every lab focuses on a specific DevOps or Prometheus-related concept, from basic metric scraping and alerting to more advanced scenarios like distributed tracing and custom exporters.

3. **Automated Validation**  
   Each lab comes with a script or tool to verify your progress. Run it locally to see if you’ve met the lab’s objectives, helping you catch mistakes early.

4. **Community-Driven**  
   Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests to add new labs, improve existing ones, or share insights with fellow learners.
